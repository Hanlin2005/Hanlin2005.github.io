                        The past two years of college I found myself swaying between different areas of science and engineering. I took an overwhelming load of classes almost every semester, convincing myself that taking enough high level classes was enough to expose me to every field, as if one day I would magically discover my passion.

                        In this short entry I want to explain the adjoint method as my way of learning the concept and applying it to solve the minimization problem posed by a differentiable simulation optimization problem.
