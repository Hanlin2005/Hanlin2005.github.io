                    The past two years of college I found myself swaying between different areas of science and engineering. 
                    I took an overwhelming load of classes almost every semester, convincing myself that taking enough high level classes was 
                    enough to expose me to every field, as if one day I would magically discover my passion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But taking many high level classes just made me complacent. I barely did any personal exploration outside of these courses, and surface-level at best. Furthermore, this lifestyle made me lose all my passion towards studying, falling into the trap of simply doing the minimum required work every day before calling it quits. Admittedly, I was not the most diligent or motivated student. As my second year passed, I couldn’t say that I had found much success in finding my future career. In fact, this life sucked away all of my passion towards studying.

                <p>
                    This summer, something magical happened. Given the opportunity to explore my own research topic, I started searching and reading papers and experimenting with simulation out of pure interest. This experience did magic on me. I started thinking a lot more in my free time and found some projects that I was genuinely excited about. I started spending my free time on this work and exploration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m creating this blog as a way to document my experiments and growth along the way. I think that explaining an idea is a great way to strengthen and improve my understanding of a concept as well as provide an avenue for future reference. Furthermore, it gives me a goal to express my creativity on this little corner of the internet. Hopefully, my experience can one day help someone in a similar situation. To my fellow wanderers – go out and forge your own path!
