In this short entry I want to explain the adjoint method as my way of learning the concept and applying it to solve the minimization problem posed by a differentiable simulation optimization problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with understanding the Lagrange multiplier.

Imagine the contours of two functions, f(x,y) = c and g(x,y) = 0. As we vary c, which is the value of the function we are trying to optimize, as long as the contour of f(x,y) is intersecting that of g(x,y), there exists x and y which satisfy both f and g. Now, we notice that c is minimized on the boundary of where these two contours intersect. Bingo! This gives us the idea that we should select the point of intersection.

                    Now, the gradients being multiples of each other make sure that the tangent vectors (or normal vectors) are the same. Thus, we derive our Lagrange multipliers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, I want to shift the topic to the lagrangian. Although not fundamentally required to understand Adjoint method, I would love to show it due to my particular interest in physics class (classical mechanics was one of my favorite classes last semester).

For the lagrangian, we are trying to find a path that minimizes the action, that is the integral of the change in potential and kinetic energy.
