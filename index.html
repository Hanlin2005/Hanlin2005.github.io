            <p>Hi! I'm a junior undergrad at Duke University working in the General Robotics Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
            Recently, I have been interested in the field of physical simulation and optimization, which has various
            applications in areas like robotics.
            </p>

            This website gathers my projects and blogs.

          <p>The internet houses an ocean of resources of varying quality. Once in a while, stashed in a forgotten corner of the internet, 
            I can find a shining gem that makes me appreciate the fact that I was born in this era. In fact, these blogs gave me the inspiration
            to design this website. I'd like to share some of these resources just in case they might be inspiring to you!
